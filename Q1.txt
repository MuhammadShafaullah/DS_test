Please write following program in Python:
User will input home address, e.g.:
house# 31, st#12, G-11/3, Islamabad 44000, capital Pakistan
Please note:
1- input can be changed, means it would be dynamic.
2- City name, zip code and country are compulsory
3- while other part of address is optional.

Your job is to divide address into parts, like:
address: house# 31, st#12, G-11/3,
city: Islamabad 
zip:  44000
state:  capital 
country:  Pakistan
Please note, output will be change on the basis of input.

e.g. if user will not enter state then output would be like:

address: house# 31, st#12, G-11/3,
city: Islamabad 
zip:  44000
country:  Pakistan

And e.g. if user will not enter street address then output would be like:

city: Islamabad 
zip:  44000
state:  capital 
country:  Pakistan

And e.g. if user will not enter both state and street address then output would be like:
city: Islamabad 
zip:  44000
country:  Pakistan

Your program should handle all possible scenarios.
